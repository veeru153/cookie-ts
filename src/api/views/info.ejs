                        Cookie is an in-house Discord bot created to gamify the Cookie House experience.
                        Each user upon joining can start baking Cookies. These cookies are spent in the Shop to obtain
                        backgrounds which are used in the user's profiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to effectively utilise the bakery features, it is important to know a few concepts and
                        commands.

                    <h3>Baking: -bake</h3>
                    <p>
                        Baking allows you to earn Cookies which can be spent in the shop. There is a
                        cooldown of 4 hours. The number of cookies dropped is randomised and is divided into the
                        following
                        tiers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>T0: 1-3 üç™</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>T1: 7-11 üç™</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>T2: 14-18 üç™</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>T3: 21-25 üç™</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The tier you get is pseudo-random and there is a pity system involved. You are guaranteed to hit
                        T3
                        once every 20 bakes.
                        The number of cookies you get from within that tier is entirely random.
                        <span style="background-color: #f47fff;">Server Boosters</span> have a x1.1 multiplier on the
                        number
                        of Cookies
                        they bake by default.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Spending: -shop</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any cookies you obtain can be spent in the Shop. The shop consists of backgrounds that you can
                        equip
                        on your profiles to show off your bias or your favourite era. There are multiple backgrounds to
                        choose from and more will be added over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To buy stuff from the shop, click "Buy". This copies a command for you which can be pasted in
                        any
                        text channel. Please be mindful of ongoing conversations. If you are batch buying, we recommend
                        you
                        use the bot channel instead.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Equipping: -mybag / -inventory</h3>
                    <p>
                        To equip any bought items, you can use the mentioned commands. These commands will take you to
                        the
                        webpage where you can see all items you have bought from the shop. To equip an item, click
                        "Equip".
                        This copies a command which can then be pasted in a text channel to equip the desired item.
